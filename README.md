Crossover test

Hi Techies,

Jeff on the move. I like music just as I like computer networking and security stuff. I am a family man with 1 wife and a son. I value them more than myself and my current job. 

I am 6 years old in IT industry and currently working in one of the largest BPO company in the world. I believe my experience as an IT professional makes me fit for this job post. If blessed enough, I will be working pretty soon in your company. Here I come, make way for me... :-)
